#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The gaming room client had a game called "Draw it or Lose it", they wanted to expand their game into a fully cross-platform web based game. This included mobile, mac, windows, and linux capabilities. 

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I did a good job at ensuring that the information was easy to understand for people who aren't as knowledgeable with the technical jargon. Communicating complicated technical requirements in an easy to understand manner is important because many clients may not know exactly what they do/don't need in an app. 

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I think working through the design document was very helpful for getting organized. The document gives you a solid outline that you can use to get started in the design process this paired with other planning tools such as a UML class diagrarm can really help you visualize what needs to be accomplished. I think it is also helpful in giving a realistic idea of the project needs meaning youre less likely to "gold plate" the app because you have something fairly specific to go off of. 

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think the development requirement table is probably my weakest part of the document. This is something that as I get more experience and learn more I will get better at determining the requirements per platform. I unfortunately don't have experience with Mac or Linux which made it difficult to properly identify potential requirements.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To interpret the user needs I simply read what they were asking for and then began researching what is needed to actual implement these requests. The user's needs are the whole point of the project, if you dont consider their needs then you have completely failed to deliver to your client. This means extensive rework or a loss of a paying customer in a highly competitive field. This will put you out of a job very quickly. The customers needs must be met in order to fulfill your part of the contract so considering the user's needs is a vital part of any project.

#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

For designing the software the first thing I did was read the customers design requests. From there I broke each request down into manageable pieces and began writing up some pseudocode for parts that I knew how to do. From there I was able to get a grasp of what I needed to research. Then I was able to just do some research and knock our any of the problems that I wasn't able to do previously. This allowed me to overcome any problems while also learning new valuable skills.
